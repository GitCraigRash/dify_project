In /internal/service:


Add a new service module (e.g., quantum_service.go or braket_service.go) to handle AWS Braket-specific operations
This will contain the business logic for interacting with AWS Braket, such as:

Quantum circuit creation
Job submission
Result processing
Error handling




In /internal/controller:


Add a new controller (e.g., quantum_controller.go) to handle HTTP requests related to quantum computing operations
Define endpoints for:

Submitting quantum computations
Checking job status
Retrieving results




In /internal/types:


Define new types/structures for:

Quantum circuit specifications
AWS Braket job configurations
Response formats for quantum results
Error types specific to quantum operations




In /internal/static:


Add configuration files for:

AWS Braket endpoints
Supported quantum devices
Default parameters
Access credentials (though these should be handled securely)




In /internal/middleware:


Potentially add middleware for:

AWS authentication
Request validation specific to quantum operations
Rate limiting for AWS Braket calls




In /test:


Add test cases for:

Quantum circuit validation
AWS Braket integration
Result processing
Error handling




In /lib:


Add shared utilities for:

Quantum circuit validation
Result formatting
Common AWS Braket operations




In /internal/server:


Update server configuration to:

Include new routes
Initialize AWS Braket client
Handle new environment variables



You might also need to:

Add new dependencies in your go.mod file for:


AWS SDK for Go
AWS Braket specific libraries
Any quantum computing utilities


Update documentation to include:


API specifications for new endpoints
Configuration requirements
Usage examples


Consider adding:


Circuit visualization capabilities
Result interpretation helpers
Error handling specific to quantum operations

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these components or provide more specific implementation details for any particular area?

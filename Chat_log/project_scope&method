###Define Goals Clearly

Confirm the specific quantum computing functionality you need (e.g., running quantum algorithms, simulating circuits).
Set objectives like integrating AWS Braket SDK into the program.
Use AI for Initial Research

Task: Use AI to summarize the repository's purpose, structure, and existing features.
Action: Input the repository's README file or core documentation into the AI for analysis. If the repository lacks documentation, use AI to extract key functions from code files.
Outline the Plan with AI Assistance

Task: Ask AI to identify areas of the repository where quantum computing logic might be integrated.
Action: Provide the AI with the repository's file directory or specific scripts for analysis.
Create Pseudocode with AI

Task: Collaborate with AI to draft pseudocode for AWS Braket integration.
Action: Share AI's outline of steps needed, such as importing the AWS Braket SDK, creating a quantum task, and handling results.
Ask AI for Suggestions on Key Challenges

Examples:
How to authenticate with AWS for Braket usage.
The best way to structure the quantum tasks within your program's architecture.
Plan Your Documentation

Task: Request AI's help in formatting your plan for future reference.
Action: Include inline comments, markdown documentation, or a separate guide.



###How to Extract the Outline from GitHub
Obtain Repository Information

Download the repository or link AI to the relevant repository URL (if supported).
Use AI tools or scripts to list all files and their purposes.
Automate Function Identification

Use AI or a script to scan for key functions and modules.
Prioritize functions related to computation, simulation, or task orchestration.
Generate AI Summaries

Paste code snippets or entire files into AI prompts.
Request summaries and suggestions for integration points.
Create a Checklist of Steps

Use AI to synthesize gathered information into a checklist for:
Environment setup.
Dependencies (e.g., boto3, amazon-braket-sdk).
Integration testing.

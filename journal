read https://dify.ai/blog/introducing-dify-workflow-file-upload-a-demo-on-ai-podcast

9:45am _______________  Goal: Find tutorial to use defy. 
Looks like defy uses a node like structure for an intuative workflow, but I still need to figure out how to set it up. 
Looking again at the README.md

The instructions say to install docker and docker compose using
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d

however, running in the terminal gives an error:
cd: no such file or directory: dify
cd: no such file or directory: docker
cp: .env.example: No such file or directory
no configuration file provided: not found

My thinking is that I need to download docker and docker compose first. 


10:00am _______________  
Reading how to install and use Docker. Docker and Docker compose are prerequisites.

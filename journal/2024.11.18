Unassigned time:

6:30 PM–6:45 PM (15 minutes)
Observations:
Productivity Bottlenecks:

Significant time spent on konkr.io (3+ hours) without clear outputs.
Learning tasks (Docker, Stable Diffusion) were interrupted and faced technical challenges, which prolonged progress.
Extended breaks (e.g., breakfast for 45 minutes, conversation with parents) reduced task efficiency.
Effective Efforts:

Dedicated time for learning Dify and writing in Notion.
Documented troubleshooting and made some progress on Docker.
Suggestions to Improve Productivity:
Time Management:

Set time limits for ambiguous tasks: Limit exploratory or passive browsing (e.g., konkre.io) to specific blocks of time with measurable outcomes.
Streamline breaks: Consolidate and shorten breaks (e.g., breakfast or social time) to regain time for focused work.
Task Prioritization:

Begin with essential tasks (e.g., completing tutorials or technical setups).
Use block scheduling: Allocate fixed durations for tasks and end when the time is up, ensuring progress across multiple priorities.
Resource Utilization:

Seek help earlier for roadblocks (e.g., Docker or Stable Diffusion setup).
Leverage forums or documentation for troubleshooting before diving into trial-and-error.
Review and Adjust Goals:

End each session with a brief summary of progress and plan for the next day.
Use a SMART goals framework: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound tasks.

9:45am _______________  Goal: Find tutorial to use defy. 
Looks like defy uses a node like structure for an intuative workflow, but I still need to figure out how to set it up. 
Looking again at the README.md

The instructions say to install docker and docker compose using
cd dify
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d

however, running in the terminal gives an error:
cd: no such file or directory: dify
cd: no such file or directory: docker
cp: .env.example: No such file or directory
no configuration file provided: not found

My thinking is that I need to download docker and docker compose first.

finding tutorial for Docker compose  

1:00pm _______________  
a potential probelm with Docker is that a file became outdated 
and now only poitns to another file. This can cuase problems, but thankfully
a certain setting "Automatically check configuration" fixes this problem.

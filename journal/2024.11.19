 Decided to stop looking up stuff and switch to trial and error. 

11:00am _______________  
Set up a simple work flow of start -> Stable Diffusion -> End
However, stable diffusion will not activat because it says
{"errors":["prompt: string must contain at least 1 character(s)"],"id":"04638e7f60e619d220c8533fd5ece2f6","name":"bad_request"}
Even if I change the name of the variable to  "prompt" it gives the same error. Why is nothing explained?

OK. Look. I am just going to read the documention... all of it. 
But first I will write a few questions to help me focus and find detrails I may need. 
Waht are the ways I can get information into the process?
What are ways I can export information from the process?
Can I calculate the cost before a prompt?
How does each step of the process connect to each other?
Are there token limits outside of the individual model token limits?
What purposes was this process designed to fulfill?
Why did the creators decide on the design choices that they chose?
Where can I find ways to get the best results?
What are the weaknesses of this program?
